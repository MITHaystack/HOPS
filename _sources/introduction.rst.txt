Introduction
============

The Haystack Observatory Post-processing System (HOPS) is a software package
used for the manipulation of data generated by Very-long-baseline interferometry
(VLBI) correlators. It is written in a combination of C/C++ and python. As 
data pipeline software it sits between the correlator and downstream 
image-processing and/or geodetic analysis packages. It's primary 
purposes are basic fringe-fitting, data calibration/editing/flagging, 
and problem diagnosis, along with other correlator support and 
visualization functions. This repository contains software from both the 
legacy HOPS3 package as well as the currently in-development HOPS4 package.
The user can optionally compile the HOPS3 software if they have the additional 
required dependencies.
