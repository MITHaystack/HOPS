The Initialization library provides a the primary mechanism for building and configuring 
operators used in VLBI fringe fitting operations. This library implements the builder pattern 
to create various correction operators, data labeling/processing components, and 
other management utilities required for VLBI data processing in the HOPS4 framework.
