Notes and limitations:

- only major executables which have been ported to the new framework are:
fourfit4
fplot4
alist4

- export to mk4 fringe types from fourfit4 is enabled with the '-k' flag. However, the following types are not populated:
type_207 -- phase cal info 
type_221 -- postscript plot
type_230 -- visibilities with fringe solution applied

- mixed LSB/USB and double sideband data is not yet supported but will be

- the command line options of fourfit4 have been kept as a similar as possible, options can be printed with fourfit4 --help 
- notably some options that are not yet implemented:

  -f,--first-plot-channel INT specifies the first channel displayed in the fringe plot (ignored, not yet implemented)
  -n,--nplot-channels INT     specifies the number of channels to display in the fringe plot (ignored, not yet implemented)
  -r,--refringe-alist TEXT    alist file for refringing (ignored, not yet implemented)
  -T,--reftime TEXT           specify the fourfit reference time (ignored, not yet implemented)
  -X,--xpower-output          output spectral cross power data (visibilities with corrections/residual fringe solution applied)

- also the '-x' option for 'xwindows' plotting has been removed/deprecated, while the '-k' option has been added for mark4 fringe output. 

- there is a table of control file keywords which are or are not supported <here>

- notably adhoc_flag and adhoc_phase files have not yet been implemented, but will be

- some fringe plot features have not yet been implemented, mainly the 'validity' tick marks for USB/LSB that sit under the channel residual phase plots 

- also pcal amp/phase is not plotted in pStokes-I mode (previously pcal from an arbitrary pol-product was plotted).

- keywords and associated features which are now deprecated are:

switched
index
max_parity float
x_crc
x_slip_sync
y_crc
y_slip_sync
gates
period
ra_offset
dec_offset
pc_freqs
use_samples
interpolator
fmatch_bw_pct

- the VGOS postprocessing scripts provided in this package work with either fourfit3 or fourfit4 (with the -k mark4 output option), but will eventually be ported to the native fourfit4 format 
- you can control which fringe fitter is used by the VGOS post-proc scripts by setting HOPS_VPAL_FRINGE_FITTER = to fourfit3 or fourfit4

the names fourfit, fplot, alist are symlinks to the v3 or v4 exectuables. The default is to point to the version 3 exectuables, however this can be toggled by the cmake flag HOPS_IS_HOPS4
