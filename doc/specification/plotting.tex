\label{sec:plotting}

The fringe fitting procedure in HOPS3 is tightly coupled with plotting, which is handled through PGPLOT. PGPLOT has been unsupported for many years and it will not be a required dependency in \nuHOPS. In \nuHOPS, fringe-fitting and plotting will be decoupled (fringe results can be generated and saved, with or without generating a plot), and the native plotting functions will be replaced with new code. We have prototyped a set of Matplotlib functions that reproduce the standard ``fringe'' plot generated by fourfit (see Figure~\ref{fig:matplotlib-fringe-plot}).

The plotting functions of \nuHOPS will be expanded, and will include hooks for users to insert their own plotting functions, interactive plots for reformatting, and simple extensibility to add features.
