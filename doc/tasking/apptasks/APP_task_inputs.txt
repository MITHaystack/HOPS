The current draft work breakdown structure is found in

   alma_phasing_draft_wbs.pdf

The additional files are an attempt to work out a set of tasks
within each area covered by this draft, based on a variety of
inputs (i.e. things known at present).  It's very preliminary,
and the focus has been on identifying tasks and some of their
dependencies.  In particular, at present most dates are guestimates.

The files in this directory are grouped:

    something.ps    is the plot
    something.key   is some words to briefly explain the
                    cryptic terms in the bubbles, and
    something.task  is all the input used to create the plots

At the moment, the "somethings" are:

    GENERAL  h/s  General Developer Time
    HW        h   Hardware
    CARD      h   Phasing Interface Card
    PREP      s   Pre VLBI Observation Preparation
    VOM       s   VLBI Observing Mode
    PHSLOW    s   VLBI Phasing System Slow
    PHFAST    s   VLBI Phasing System Fast
    DAS       s   VLBI Data Acquisition System
    HMASER    s   Hydrogen Maser
    GUI       s   Graphical User Interface
    POST      s   Post VLBI Observation Data Analysis
    TESTA     s   Integration Testing (Software A)
    TESTB     s   Integration Testing (Software B)
    TESTH    h/s  Integration Testing (Hardware)
    TESTO    h/s  Integration Testing (Observations)

and these are either "domains" (topics in the work breakdown structure)
or "things" (several of which constitute a domain):

  domain = collection of related things (s == software, h == hardware):
  thing  = some piece of a domain, which is a collection of tasks:
  task   = something to be done to complete the thing
  desc   = a more complete description of the domain/thing/task
  nick   = short name for the domain/thing/task

tasks require the following

  path   = where thing is to be found in the CVS repository (or none)
  code   = C++,Java,Python,Other,none
  who    = ,-sep list of workers (worker[:effort]) or institutions

timeline information

  needs  = list of predecessor tasks
  start  = start date
  days   = real man-days of FTE effort by pri/sec/men
  done   = percentage complete
  derate = multiplier on days to get calendar days
  done   = percent complete (0-100)
  stop   = completion date (== 'start' for milestones)
  allows = list of successor tasks

I started collecting this information with an eye towards the software
effort, so it is very software-centric, but I've recently added some
tasks related to various hardware items.
