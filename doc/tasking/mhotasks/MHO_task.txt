# This is the list of domains/things/tasks for the HOPS4 project.

# The items in this list are trying to capture interconnectedness
# (through the needs/allows fields) and approximate dates. It's a 
# living document, changes will be frequent.  See MHO_task_inputs.txt
# for some explanations of this file.  ### is meant to be grepped for

### some common abbreviations (saving you typing)

@vlbi   = Very Long Base Interferometry
@sec    = Section

### some dates of interest (milestones, @t*)

# It is useful to collect the timeline in one place where you can see it
# @t... is used canonically to abbreviate dates for later.  As we add
# internal check-points, they should be defined here which then allows
# margin calculations for tasks that lead up to that date.

### Major Domains of activity
#

domain = General Project Activities
nick   = GENERAL
desc   = This covers things not better captured elsewhere

domain = Infrastructure Setup
nick   = INFRA
desc   = Everything to create a working environment

domain = Fourfit application development
nick   = FOURFIT
desc   = Build the new fourfit application

domain = Calibration routine development
nick   = CALI
desc   = Develop the new calibration routines

domain = Visualization library development
nick   = VIZ
desc   = Develop the new plotting and visualization tools



domain = HOPS4 Documentation
nick   = DOCS
desc   = Production of the documents that for the HOPS4 project.
         This includes the initial plan, the requirements,
         the software development plan, the coverage and test
         plan and later, test reports and man pages and user manuals.

# this is a placeholder
domain = Everything Else
nick   = STUFF
desc   = This domain covers everything not otherwise mentioned.
         It is useful to have this at the outset as a "sink" for
         all the undefined things.  Eventually it can disappear.

###  Things by Domain
#

#   GENERAL     General Project Activities
domain = @GENERAL
thing  = Milestones
nick   = Miles
desc   = This contains various dates in the overview timeline

thing  = Meetings and Other Activities
nick   = Meetings
desc   = This covers meetings (zoom or otherwise) and
         various discussions and bureaucracy that are not
         otherwise captured in work-type tasks but which
         still eat time

#   INFRA       Infrastructure Setup
domain = @INFRA
thing  = Repository related things
nick   = Repo
desc   = This covers creation and maintenance of the repository, as
         well as other things that happen at the repository level such
         as build systems, filesystem refactoring, &c.

thing  = Prototyping activities
nick   = ProtoCode
desc   = This covers targeted experiments on how to do various things.
         There is a fuzzy line between this and actual design work for
         specific tasks...but we shall know when the line is crossed.

         (before the project started).  Portions of it are later
         captured in other documents, and the remainder that still
         applies is in the Software Development Plan

thing  = Requirements
nick   = ReqsDoc
