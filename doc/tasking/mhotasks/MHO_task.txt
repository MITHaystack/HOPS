### Major Domains of activity
#

domain = General Project Activities
nick   = GENERAL
desc   = This covers things not better captured elsewhere

domain = Infrastructure Setup
nick   = INFRA
desc   = Everything to create a working environment

domain = HOPS4 Documentation
nick   = DOCS
desc   = Production of the documents that for the HOPS4 project.
         This includes the initial plan, the requirements,
         the software development plan, the coverage and test
         plan and later, test reports and man pages and user manuals.

# this is a placeholder
domain = Everything Else
nick   = STUFF
desc   = This domain covers everything not otherwise mentioned.
         It is useful to have this at the outset as a "sink" for
         all the undefined things.  Eventually it can disappear.

### Build tools (automake, cmake)
### Prototyping (containers, SWIG)
### HOPS3 to HOPS4 migration 
### Fourfit application 
### alist/aedit 
### Algorithms 
### Objects 
### Interference 
### Calibration 
### Processing 
### Visualization

###  Things by Domain
#

#   GENERAL     General Project Activities
domain = @GENERAL
thing  = Milestones
nick   = Miles
desc   = This contains various dates in the overview timeline

thing  = Meetings and Other Activities
nick   = Meetings
desc   = This covers meetings (zoom or otherwise) and
         various discussions and bureaucracy that are not
         otherwise captured in work-type tasks but which
         still eat time

#   INFRA       Infrastructure Setup
domain = @INFRA
thing  = Repository related things
nick   = Repo
desc   = This covers creation and maintenance of the repository, as
         well as other things that happen at the repository level such
         as build systems, filesystem refactoring, &c.

thing  = Prototyping activities
nick   = ProtoCode
desc   = This covers targeted experiments on how to do various things.
         There is a fuzzy line between this and actual design work for
         specific tasks...but we shall know when the line is crossed.

domain = @DOCS
thing  = Project Development Plan
nick   = ProjPlan
desc   = This refers to the initial plan drawn up at the outset
         (before the project started).  Portions of it are later
         captured in other documents, and the remainder that still
         applies is in the Software Development Plan

thing  = Requirements
nick   = ReqsDoc
desc   = Define the requirements of the HOPS4 project

thing  = Coverage and Testing
nick   = CoTestDoc
desc   = Define the tests that will be used in HOPS4
