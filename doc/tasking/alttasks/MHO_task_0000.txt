# This is the list of domains/things/tasks for the HOPS4 project.

# The items in this list are trying to capture interconnectedness
# (through the needs/allows fields) and approximate dates. It's a 
# living document, changes will be frequent.  See MHO_task_inputs.txt
# for some explanations of this file.  ### is meant to be grepped for
# structure, and # to be grepped out.

### some dates of interest (milestones, @t*)

# It is useful to collect the timeline in one place where you can see it
# @t... is used canonically to abbreviate dates for later.  As we add
# internal check-points, they should be defined here which then allows
# margin calculations for tasks that lead up to that date.
