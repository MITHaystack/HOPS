nick   = Fourfit3Import-files
desc   = This covers the design of the directory structure for the legacy fourfit
         libraries, and sketching out where the files live. This probably requires some care
	 and thought to facilitate the makefiles later.

desc   = Kick the tires - make sure the legacy fourfit application compiles and
         runs in the HOPS4 distro. Do the check scripts work? Does the build work
	 in a variety of environments?

@gentask
desc   = Does the legacy fourfit application work in the HOPS4 distro? Does it
         work in a variety of environments? This is a moment for all team
