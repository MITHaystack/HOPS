# This is the list of domains/things/tasks for the HOPS4 project.

# The items in this list are trying to capture interconnectedness
# (through the needs/allows fields) and approximate dates. It's a 
# living document, changes will be frequent.  See MHO_task_inputs.txt
# for some explanations of this file.  ### is meant to be grepped for
# structure, and # to be grepped out.

### some common abbreviations (saving you typing)
@vlbi   = Very Long Base Interferometry
@sec    = Section
@req    = the HOPS4 Requirements document
@tbm    = Tasking Bubble Machine
@SVN    = the HOPS3 repo: https://vault.haystack.mit.edu/svn/hops
@GIT    = the HOPS4 repo: https://github.mit.edu/barrettj/hops-git.git

### some dates of interest (milestones, @t*)

# It is useful to collect the timeline in one place where you can see it
# @t... is used canonically to abbreviate dates for later.  As we add
# internal check-points, they should be defined here which then allows
# margin calculations for tasks that lead up to that date.
#
# To prevent merging problems, use your initials for dates you want
# to put on things you worked on in this list...and then reference them
# in the tasks.  I.e. @gc... is a Geoff date, @vp... is a Violet date.
# Then all we have to do is keep this list approximately sorted.
