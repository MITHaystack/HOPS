         variant of VEX to be made.  There is a script for this, but it
         doesn't always work.  This task is to fix that for HOPS3.

desc   = Aedit used to generate a PostScript summary plot, however that only
         works if there is a so-called OVEX file and that is broken currently
         in most experiments.  (See the task, @AeditSummary-Ovex3.)  The plot
         is then made with PGPLOT and should be re-implemented in Python.
