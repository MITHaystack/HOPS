task   = Create staging nightly build area
nick   = DifxVendor-staging
@shtask
desc   = Repositories are usually owned by one person (in contrast
         to filesystems that--through group permissions--may be handled
         by many).  To simply replicate the HOPS3 model, it is sufficient
         for all HOPS4 developers to have a nightly build area that is a
         relatively pristine place to stage a DiFX version vend from.

task   = Adjust DiFX repository
nick   = DifxVendor-DiFXrepodesign
desc   = The DiFX team is in the midst of migration from SVN to GIT.
         This will most likely be concluded prior to the need to develop
         a vending process.  Assuming so, the HOPS3 instructions need to
         be adjusted (svn becomes git for DiFX) and decisions on how this
         is to be done should be made.  Note that the SVN to GIT migration
         of DiFX is an external dependency.  (No date yet.)

         this task is to create the procedure and/or scripts to make it
         do-able in a hour or so.
