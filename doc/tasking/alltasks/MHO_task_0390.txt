desc   = Aedit can make plots and for some of them interact with the user
         who can click on things and edit the alist or modify the plot, &c.
         This task is to understand what exists in HOPS3, identify how it
         should be expanded/preserved in HOPS4 and fill out the remaining
         tasks for this...  A significant component of the design is that
         it should have an interface adaptable to more than one plotting
         package (i.e. PGPLOT).

desc   = Fourfit (and Fplot) relies on a fringe plot format.  This task
         is to study how it is handled in HOPS3 and work out how it should
         change to meet the expanded needs of HOPS4.  Then an interface
         needs to be created so that this can be ported to more than one
         set of display tools (i.e. not just PGPLOT).
