domain = Infrastructure Setup
nick   = INFRA
desc   = Everything to create and complete a working environment

         This includes alist, aedit, adump and afio.

domain = Import HOPS3 Other things to HOPS4
nick   = OTHER3
desc   = Import other executables and scripts to HOPS4.
         This includes average, fringex, search, cofit, etc.

domain = Refactor ffcontrol library
nick   = FFCONTROL
desc   = Refactor the ffcontrol library

domain = Refactor ffcore library
nick   = FFCORE
desc   = Refactor the ffcore library

domain = Refactor ffplot library
nick   = FFPLOT

domain = Generic fourfit refactoring things
nick   = NEWFOURFIT
desc   = Generic domain for refactoring tasks of the fourfit C libraries. Tying up 
	 loose ends, extending where needed, reviewing the status of the C code, 
	 tracking what will be needed for interfaces and the C++ libraries.


domain = Refactor A Machinery
nick   = AMACHINERY
desc   = This involves many things, including refactoring Aedit
         (to not use PGPLOT for starters), but also includes the
         average and fringex machinery which is critical for
         mm VLBI analyses.

domain = Import and Export interfaces
nick   = INTERFACES
desc   = Develop and implement framework for import and
         export between the external world and HOPS4.
         HOPS3 used difx2mark4 and provides alists and
         the mk4 correlation products.  The new input
         interface starts with the SWIN products and
         ends with hops correlation products and other
         formats for export.




domain = Utilities library
nick   = UTILS
desc   = Develop the new utilities library. This covers commonly-used
	 functions, like date handling, profiling, toolboxes etc.

domain = Message library
nick   = MESSAGE
desc   = Develop the new messaging library. This covers the messages
	 and logs to the user, with handles for verbosity, topics, etc.

domain = Containers library
nick   = CONTAINERS
desc   = Develop the new containers library. This covers the
	 in-memory data containers of visibility and meta-data,
	 and native format disk I/O.

domain = Operators library
nick   = OPERATORS
desc   = Develop the new operators library. This covers base classes for
	 data manipulation and generic operations (array reduction, transposition,
	 FFT, etc.)

domain = Math library
nick   = MATH
desc   = Develop the new math library. This covers FFTW, minimizers, interfaces
	 to optional third-party math libraries, and so on.

domain = VLBI Calibration library
nick   = VCAL
desc   = Develop the new library for VLBI-specific operators (bandpass correction,
	 per-channel phase offsets, etc). Overlap with CALI domain.

domain = Mk4 Interface library
nick   = MK4INTER
desc   = Develop the new mk4 interface library, for import/export to legacy Mk4
	 data types. Allows testing and backwards compatibility. (Note, may be superceded
	 by the INTERFACES domain?)


domain = Bindings
nick   = BINDINGS
desc   = Python interfaces to C++ data containers and operators. Allows for Python scripts
	 for initialization of data containers and operators, and hooks for user-defined
	 manipulation of data.



domain = Review C++ libraries
nick   = CPPREVIEW
desc   = This covers the review of the new C++ libraries.


domain = Calibration routine development
nick   = CALI
desc   = Develop the new calibration routines

domain = Visualization library development
nick   = VIZ
desc   = Develop the new plotting and visualization tools


domain = HOPS4 Documentation
nick   = DOCS
desc   = Production of the documents that for the HOPS4 project.
         This includes the initial plan, the requirements,
         the software development plan, the coverage and test
         plan and later, test reports and man pages and user manuals.


# this is a placeholder
domain = Everything Else
nick   = STUFF
desc   = This domain covers everything not otherwise mentioned.
         It is useful to have this at the outset as a "sink" for
         all the undefined things.  Eventually this domain and
         all the things and tasks in it should migrate upward to
         other domains, things, or tasks.
