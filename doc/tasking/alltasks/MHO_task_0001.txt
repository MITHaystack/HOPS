domain = Import HOPS3 A-things to HOPS4
nick   = AEDIT3
desc   = Import A-things to HOPS4
         This includes alist, aedit, adump and afio.

domain = Import HOPS3 Other things to HOPS4
nick   = OTHER3
desc   = Import other executables and scripts to HOPS4.
         This includes average, fringex, search, cofit, &c.

domain = Refactor A Machinery
nick   = AMACHINERY
desc   = This involves many things, including refactoring Aedit
         (to not use PGPLOT for starters), but also includes the
         average and fringex machinery which is critical for
         mm VLBI analyses.

domain = Import and Export interfaces
nick   = INTERFACES
desc   = Develop and implement framework for import and
         export between the external world and HOPS4.
         HOPS3 used difx2mark4 and provides alists and
         the mk4 correlation products.  The new input
         interface starts with the SWIN products and
         ends with hops correlation products and other
         formats for export.

domain = Calibration routine development
nick   = CALI
desc   = Develop the new calibration routines

domain = Visualization library development
nick   = VIZ
desc   = Develop the new plotting and visualization tools

         This includes the initial plan, the requirements,

# this is a placeholder
domain = Everything Else
nick   = STUFF
desc   = This domain covers everything not otherwise mentioned.
         It is useful to have this at the outset as a "sink" for
         all the undefined things.  Eventually this domain and
         all the things and tasks in it should migrate upward to
         other domains, things, or tasks.
