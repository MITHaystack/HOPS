PGPLOT is not a requirement of HOPS4, but is still needed in order to compile most HOPS3 applications (e.g. fourfit3)

For Debian/Ubuntu based operating systems pgplot can be installed via the package manager with:

```
sudo apt-get install pgplot5 libgfortran5
```

For RHEL/Fedora based distributions PGPLOT will need to be installed from source. The PGPLOT source can be retrieved with:
```
curl -O ftp://ftp.astro.caltech.edu/pub/pgplot/pgplot5.2.tar.gz 
```
and built by following the instructions here: https://guaix.fis.ucm.es/~ncl/howto/howto-pgplot

However, be aware that modern compilers tend to be good deal pickier about implicit function declarations, 
and (at least on Fedora40) you may need to modify the PGPLOT source to get it to compile. This requires ensuring the proper 
include declarations are present in a couple files where compilations fails. The prime culprits being these missing includes: 
```
#include <string.h> // for strncpy()
#include <fcntl.h>  // for open() 
#include <unistd.h> // for close()
```
If you are not comfortable modifying the PGPLOT source, please use a Debian/Ubuntu based distribution with a pgplot5 package 
or forgo HOPS3 plotting functionality.
