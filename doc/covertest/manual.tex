\section{Human GUI Testing}
\label{sec:manual}

%this can be words about procedural testing of the command line
%and GUI interfaces
% Not sure if they need as much detail as this. This table would consist of the actual tests that would be run.
Manual testing involves a developer running the latest build and testing the user interface

\subsection{Manual testing to be applied to following requirements}
\label{sec:manreqs}

\begin{description}
% File I/O and Supported File Types
\reqid{A} HOPS4 shall support input from the DiFX \cite{deller2007difx,deller2011difx} correlator (in Swinburne format).
\reqid{A} every application should provide
  \verb+--help+ and \verb+--version+ responses (with zero exit status)
  to behave as conventional \acs{GNU/Linux} applications.
\reqex{Command-line arguments should be implemented with a
  standard argument parsing library, and should respond helpfully
  on bad command-line syntax.}
\reqid{A} HOPS4 shall support input from \acs{VEX} version 1.5.
\reqid{A} All plotting tools provided in HOPS4 shall have the ability to save the image to
  a standard graphics format.
\reqex{HOPS4 has the desire to support as much plotting flexibility as possible, including plot formats (fonts, panels, etc).}
\reqid{D} HOPS4 shall provide an application to support export of native
  data types to a \TBD~archival format (\eg~HDF5).

% Post Processing and Fringe Plots
\reqid{A} The functionality of the program \acs{cofit} shall be preserved.
  \reqex{\texttt{chk\_cofit.sh} currently verifies this.}
\reqid{P} It should be possible to make 2D plots of the type currently possible
  within \texttt{\acs{aedit}} of HOPS3.
\reqex{These are plots such as \acs{SNR} with time broken out by baseline with
  separate symbols per target. It is not currently possible, but should be possible
  to combine several baselines into a composite plot.}
\reqid{P} HOPS4 shall implement interactive visualization tools in \acs{fourfit}.
and viewing fourfit results with an expanded scale.}
\reqid{D} Replace the existing \acs{fourfit} control file with a
  \acs{Python}-based control file. Currently existing functionality shall be
  preserved.
\reqex{This is tested with \texttt{testfourfit.sh}.The existing control file should continue to be supported. The new
  control file functionality will not likely be back-ported to HOPS3.}
\reqid{A} Every data type written to disk in HOPS4 shall be convertable to
  form that is amenable to human examination (e.g. ASCII or CSV), as is done in HOPS3 by the
  \texttt{\acs{CorAsc2}} program.
