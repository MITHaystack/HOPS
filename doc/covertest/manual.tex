\section{Manual Testing}
\label{sec:manual}

Manual tests are intended to verify requirements that demand human interpretation, for example a plotting GUI.
These full scope and nature of these tests is to be determined but would be applied to the following requirements
in addition to any other interactive tools (largely visualization) developed.

\begin{description}
  
\item{\textbf{P-25}} Make 2D plots of the type currently possible within aedit. Currently partially automated with \textbf{chk\_aedit.sh}.
\item{\textbf{P-26}} Make 3D visualization plots - Initially, some human reviewer will need to validate the plots; once the plotting routine is functional there can be an automated script that checks that the plots can be generated from captured data.

% File I/O and Supported File Types
%\reqid{A} HOPS4 shall support input from the DiFX \cite{deller2007difx,deller2011difx} correlator (in Swinburne format).
%\reqid{A} every application should provide
%  \verb+--help+ and \verb+--version+ responses (with zero exit status)
%  to behave as conventional \acs{GNU/Linux} applications.
%\reqex{Command-line arguments should be implemented with a
%  standard argument parsing library, and should respond helpfully
%  on bad command-line syntax.}
%\reqid{A} HOPS4 shall support input from \acs{VEX} version 1.5.
%\reqid{A} All plotting tools provided in HOPS4 shall have the ability to save the image to
%  a standard graphics format.
%\reqex{HOPS4 has the desire to support as much plotting flexibility as possible, including plot formats (fonts, panels, etc).}
%\reqid{D} HOPS4 shall provide an application to support export of native
%  data types to a \TBD~archival format (\eg~HDF5).

% Post Processing and Fringe Plots
%\reqid{A} The functionality of the program \acs{cofit} shall be preserved.
%  \reqex{\texttt{chk\_cofit.sh} currently verifies this.}
%\reqid{P} It should be possible to make 2D plots of the type currently possible
%  within \texttt{\acs{aedit}} of HOPS3.
%\reqex{These are plots such as \acs{SNR} with time broken out by baseline with
%  separate symbols per target. It is not currently possible, but should be possible
%  to combine several baselines into a composite plot.}
%\reqid{P} HOPS4 shall implement interactive visualization tools in \acs{fourfit}.
%and viewing fourfit results with an expanded scale.}
%\reqid{D} Replace the existing \acs{fourfit} control file with a
%  \acs{Python}-based control file. Currently existing functionality shall be
%  preserved.
%\reqex{This is tested with \texttt{testfourfit.sh}.The existing control file should continue to be supported. The new
%  control file functionality will not likely be back-ported to HOPS3.}
%\reqid{A} Every data type written to disk in HOPS4 shall be convertable to
%  form that is amenable to human examination (e.g. ASCII or CSV), as is done in HOPS3 by the
%  \texttt{\acs{CorAsc2}} program.
