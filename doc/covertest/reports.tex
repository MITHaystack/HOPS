\section{Reports}
\label{sec:reports}

The goal of the testing plan is to generate reports that document the results of the tests, the progress towards fulfilling the requirements, and code coverage. Reports are human-readable documents that summarize the success and failure of the tests at various stages (commit, build, weekly, etc).

The coverage and testing reports may be directly used by project management to monitor progress. The exact content and format of these reports is to be determined.

The nightly build process generates a summary report on progress
against requirements.
