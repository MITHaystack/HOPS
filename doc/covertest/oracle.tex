\section{Test Oracle}
\label{sec:oracle}
HOPS 3 being the previous release will be used as a test oracle for HOPS 4. This means that
results from HOPS 4 will be compared with the results and expected behavior of HOPS 3 using
the same test data. This is some sense similar to regression testing, however its purpose
is not intended to discover news issues introduced during development, but rather to ensure
that the new code replicates a known correct result. By its nature this sort of test can only be applied
to data and processes supported by the oracle software (HOPS3).

The tests listed under the regression testing section {\label{sec:regress} can be used for a sub-set of
oracle testing to compare HOPS 4 to HOPS 3 and can be automated. For example, the comparison of the SNR
of a fringe result can quantitatively be determined to be within tolerance of each other. Tests of the user interface and interactive 
sessions (e.g. aedit) they must be done in a manual manner.
