\section{Benchmark Testing}
\label{sec:benchmark}

The HOPS4 requirements specify that the existing performance tool (\texttt{account}) ``shall be augmented with more sophisticated tools'' (requirement \textbf{D-38}).

%this can be words about benchmark testing with scripts
% Clarification needed? Do we need benchmarking or performance analysis.
% If the latter then what is below is relevant.
For memory and CPU performance analysis we will use Valgrind or another tool like it with regards to the HOPS C code.

\FIX[TBD - need to define the tools, describe what they need to measure, and as the code is written define benchmarks that need to be met \& maintained.]
