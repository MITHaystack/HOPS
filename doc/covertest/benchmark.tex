\label{sec:benchmark}

The HOPS4 requirements specify that the existing performance tool (\texttt{account}) ``shall be augmented with more sophisticated tools'' (requirement \textbf{D-38}).
To that end a timer class has been implemented which will be enabled via compile-time flags.  This timer will be inserted at logically separate block in the code and be 
used to profile the absolute wall clock time used by various components of project in order to identify bottlenecks. 
For understanding memory use and making relative measures of CPU resource utilization by executables in this project we will use the Valgrind (cachegrind) tool.
