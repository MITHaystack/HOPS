\section{Continuous Integration Testing}
\label{sec:integration}

Continuous Integration is the process of merging all the working copies of the code
base in to master and running automated tests on the result of that merge, often 
several times a day. This is a component of requirement \textbf{A-6}.

Currently HOPS3 supports continuous integration by way of nightly automated scripts 
that report back the results of those tests to the development team.
The HOPS development team plans to continue to utilize this automated testing
and make it compatible with HOPS4. The HOPS development team will also explore augmenting the current 
nightly automated script with a freely available and widely accepted CI tool utilized by the open source 
development community such as Github Actions.
