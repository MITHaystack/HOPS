\section{Integration Testing}
\label{sec:integration}

%this can be words about integration regression testing with scripts
Currently HOPS3 supports continuous integration by way of nightly automated scripts 
that report back the results of those tests to the development team.
The HOPS development team plans to continue to utilize this automated testing
and make it compatible with HOPS4. The HOPS development team plans to explore the posibility
of replacing the current nightly automated script with a freely available and widely
accepted CI tool utilized by the open source development community such as Github Actions.
