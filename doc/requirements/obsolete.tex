\section{Obsolete/Other HOPS tests}
\label{sec:obsolete}

This section lists some tests present in the existing HOPS which likely
do not require support going forwards.  These are listed for completeness
and may be adopted into \ac{MHO}.
\begin{description}
% ./postproc/fearfit/Makefile.am
\reqid{X} \texttt{hook\_import.sh} which was used to allow tracking of
    changes in \ac{fourfit} to a deviant version called \texttt{fearfit}.
% ./misc/plan/Makefile.am
\reqid{X} \texttt{check\_dsolv.sh}
\reqid{X} \texttt{check\_multifit\_test.sh}
\reqid{X} \texttt{check\_dsolv3.sh}
% ./misc/time/Makefile.am
\reqid{X} \texttt{check\_hops\_time.sh}
\reqid{X} \texttt{lifetest} leap-second tracking test
% ./chops/source/python_src/tests/Makefile.am
\reqid{X} \texttt{test\_harness.sh}
% ./postproc/fourfit/Makefile.am
\reqid{X} \texttt{fft\_chk} a test to verify the transition from native
    \ac{FFT} code to \ac{FFTW3} code
% ./sub/util/Makefile.am
\reqid{X} \texttt{test\_root\_id} a test to verify the ``new root code''
    scheme which was introduced in 2018.  The next ``rollover'' of the
    clock (in the current definition) is many decades in the future,
    and going to 7 digits on the root code takes us centuries into the
    future.
% ./sub/afio/Makefile.am
\reqid{X} \texttt{check\_sizes} a script to verify compiled sizes of
    things in \ac{aedit}
