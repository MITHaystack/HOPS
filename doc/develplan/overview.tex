\subsection{Work to be done}
For the complete list of work items to be done, refer to the HOPS 4 Requirements document.
\subsection{Assumptions and Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
Community VEX Standard remains at v1.5.1.
Due to the standard hardware our users have access to, memory leaks are not of utmost concern. 
Using the new automation tool will automate and streamline the code review process.
The requirements as they are currently stated will not be modified.
The data container architecture that has been implemented is modular and flexible enough to be adapted to new data types.
\end{itemize}

HOPS 4 Requirements Document
HOPS 4 Software Specifications Document
HOPS 4 Software Development Plan
