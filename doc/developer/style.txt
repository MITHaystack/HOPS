General guidance on style.  A more complete discussion is given in
the development plan.  This is a starter....

Copyright: all files should include a current-date MIT copyright and
    a reference to the top-level Copyright file, e.g. in C++ source.

    // (c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ????-2020
    // The contents of the top-level Copyright statement apply here.

    If other copyrights apply or copyright does not belong to MIT
    (for files brought in from elsewhere) suitable adjustments should
    be made.

Modularity
  Directory level:
    Source material should be sensibly decomposed into modular self-contained
    units according to best practices by language.  A directory may build
    multiple items of related functionality
  File level:
    Within a file, functional (functions/methods) should ideally be "visible"
    within a window of at most 80? columns and 45? lines.  This should be
    violated if there are preformance or other sensible reasons for doing
    so.  The point of this is to allow a develop to "see" what is going on.
    (Material that is off the screen is usually out of mind, and errors may
    easily result from inconsistencies that may result.)
  Variables:
    Should be given short, non-cryptic names, and almost never single letter.
    Camel case or snake case are both acceptable.
  End of File:
    Files are on rare occasion truncated.  Some end of file marker should be
    included (if the language allows it).  It may be followed by special vim
    edit commands if the file requires it.

Documentation
  C/C++ Code
    Should be documented for processing by doxygen
  Python
    Should be documented for processing by sphinx
  Bash / Perl
    dunno
