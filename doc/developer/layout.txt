For those of you working with both git and hops source trees,
this is perhaps a sane layout in you HOPS_ROOT or MHO_ROOT area:

  *svn*
  *trunk*       # some svn checkout of trunk or some svn branch
  build*-3.xx   # a place where build-3.xx is built.  due to the
                # various config options, you may have several
                # active at once
  x86_64*-3.22  # installation directory for SVN products

  *git*
  hops-git      # your clone of the MIT github repo
  *             # if git worktree ... works as advertized you could
                # in theory check out multiple git branches with
                # appropriate names
  ambld*-4.xx   # a place to build under automake
  cmbld*-4.xx   # a place to build under cmake
  x86_64am-4.xx # where autotools currently install
  x86_64-4.00   # where cmake currently installs
                # (I'm tempted to suggest x86_64cm-4.00 as a place for
                # cmake to install to so comparisons are easier

  *data*        # or anything else would be directories to hold data

I plan to follow this layout for the night build process.
