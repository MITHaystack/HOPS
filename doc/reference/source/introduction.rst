Introduction
============

The Haystack Observatory Post-processing System (HOPS) is a software package used for the manipulation of data generated by VLBI correlators. 
It is written in a combination of C/C++ and python and sits between the correlator and downstream image-processing and/or geodetic analysis packages. 
It's primary purposes are basic fringe-fitting, data editing, problem diagnosis, and correlator support functions.
