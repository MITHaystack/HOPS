# File of mappings for tests to formal MSRI requirements
#
# The first column should be a chk test name (i.e. "something" as used
# by the template). The subsequent columns should be requirements
# references from the MSRI Requirements document.  Lines beginning with
# a # are ignored.  A test may be relevant to more than one requirement
# (and it may not be relevant to any requirements).  This information
# is used to set MHO_REGRESSION_REQ for each named test.  If a test
# is not mentioned, MHO_REGRESSION_REQ is set to 'ok'.
