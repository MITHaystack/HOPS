This is a file to track status on SVN to GIT transition.

The scripts in import_scripts cover portions of the HOPS3(SVN)
source tree and map files one-to-one to HOP4(GIT) tree, but the
source tree arrangement is different and thus a straightforward
rsync does not work.  The scripts use md5sum within a workhorse
script import_scripts/compare_src_dest.sh to do the actual work.
Then a top-level import_hops.sh script drives a (long) list of
import_something.sh scripts.  Note that the organization
corresponds to destination within the HOPS4 tree

A check test in data (import_from_hops3.sh) may be run in the top
data directory to check on the status of the two trees.  It includes
a case switch to allow configuration on various machines as needed:
the switch is on $USER-`hostname` to set variables to the required
SVN and GIT source directories.  (It just looks at what is present
and does not do any updates.  Presumably the two trees are both on
trunk and master rather than development branches.)

Thus between legacy_tar.sh (which makes source tarballs and
populates the $MHO_REGRESSION_DATA) area and import_hops.sh,
everything should be covered.  legacy_tar.sh was current as of
Aug 21 2021.  Updates are required for source tree additions
and new test data sets.
